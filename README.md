This program aims to be a dead simple note taking application, powered by VSCode's editor and implementing the features that matters

What's planned:
- Multiplatform support
- Restoring all files (saved or not) between sessions. Don't save, ever, it'll be okay.
- Compare files and display diffs
- JSON outline
- Markdown support, to take some *pretty* notes.
